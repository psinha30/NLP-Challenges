The main part of NLP used here is the Tf-idf method:
Predict the tag:
In this part, we predict the tag on the test data. We perform in 2 steps : general and local.
The general part will be done before. Indeed, we keep the best word found in the part tf-idf. For each question that we have to predict the tag, we will use one of these tags named “potential_tag”.
These words allow to understand that we are in the category “physic”.

The second step is based on create a tf idf split on each question, and not split on each category. It allows to precise the tag for each question.
Now, we’ll keep the 3 best word order by tf-idf for each question.

Now, we have all the element to create the best predict tag. Indeed, we have the vector “potential_tag” and for each question, 3 word which can be a tag. So for example, we can keep the first word in the vector “potential_tag” and add the 2 best word come from “df”

end:
In the above paragraph there is nothing to write as the Tf-idf model would be buolt and this intersting concept of model would be applied
